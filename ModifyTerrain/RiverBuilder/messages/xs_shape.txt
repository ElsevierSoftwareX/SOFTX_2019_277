STRING (AU, SU or TZ)- The shape of the cross section on the Y-Z plane. Input must be AU, SU, or TZ(n), where n is the number of edges that defines the length of the trapezoidal base such that 0 < n < (Y-Z Increments). It is recommended that unless you really know what you are doing with AU or are starting from a good AU template file, then only use SU or TZ. Using AU requires specifying sub reach parameters.
