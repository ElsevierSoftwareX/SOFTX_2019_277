-	Channel XS Pointsâ€“ the number of equally spaced points defining the channel's cross section. This is not applied outside the channel, only in it. Beyond the channel, River Builder provides you with points along the major breaklines, and then you can interpolate the terrain between those on your own later using a TIN approach. Input must be a positive integer greater than 1. For field data collection in a U-shaped channel, people commonly use ~ 15-30 points. An odd number is wise if you want to have a line of output points exactly in the center of the channel.
