Median Sediment Size (D50) - the particle size of the material comprising the river bed. Input must be a positive real number. This is only used if one has left Hbf=0 and wants to compute the bankfull depth value associated with the initialization of bed material transport for this specified grain size. This value is used in conjunction with the critical Shields stress value as explained earlier.
