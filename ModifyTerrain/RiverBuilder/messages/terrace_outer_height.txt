Outer Terrace Edge Height (meters) - the incremental increase in elevation from the outer edge of the floodplain to the outer edge of the terrace on the Y-Z plane. Input must be a real number, zero or larger. If this number is close to zero, then the terrace is essentially flat. If it is high, then the terrace is sloped.
